                  Situated in the heart of St Davids - Britains smallest city -
                  MamGu Welshcakes don't just sell traditional and alternative
                  welsh cakes but is a warm, welcoming and cosy cafe found in
                  the ruins of St Marys Chapel, a 14th century part of St Davids
                  Cathedral. Serving a delicious twist on old Welsh dishes, with
                  Welsh Rarebit, Cawl, and Crempogs to name a few. The MamGu
                  kitchen is proud to source almost all ingredients locally as
                  possible - this paired with the idea to teach visitors about
                  the welsh culture and to push its boundaries blend for a truly
                  memorable experience.

                  pub is our pretty sun trapped beer garden where meals are
                  served al fresco, or where you can just enjoy a refreshing
                  drink or perhaps a coffee. The menu is ever changing, both for
                  lunch and dinner and dependent upon the availability of fresh
